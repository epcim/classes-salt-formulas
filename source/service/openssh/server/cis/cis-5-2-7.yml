# 5.2.7 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled (Scored)
#
# Profile Applicability
# ---------------------
# - Level 1 - Server
# - Level 1 - Workstation
#
# Description
# -----------
# The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through
# trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts , or /etc/hosts.equiv , along with successful public
# key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.
#
# Rationale
# ---------
# Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf ,
# disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection .
#
# Audit
# -----
# Run the following command and verify that output matches:
#
#   # grep "^HostbasedAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   HostbasedAuthentication no
#
# Remediation
# -----------
# Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
#
#   HostbasedAuthentication no

parameters:
  openssh:
    server:
      host_auth: False
