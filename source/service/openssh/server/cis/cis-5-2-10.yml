#
# Profile Applicability
# ---------------------
# - Level 1 - Server

#
# Description
# -----------
# The PermitUserEnvironment option allows users to present environment options to the
# ssh daemon.
#
# Rationale

# potentially allow users to bypass security controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has
# ssh executing trojan'd programs)
#
# Audit
# -----
# Run the following command and verify that output matches:
#
#   # grep PermitUserEnvironment /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   PermitUserEnvironment no
#
# Remediation
# -----------
# Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
#
#   PermitUserEnvironment no

  openssh:
    server:
      permit_user_environment: False
