# 5.2.12 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Scored)
#
# Profile Applicability
# ---------------------
# - Level 1 - Server
# - Level 1 - Workstation
#
# Description
# -----------
# The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of
# ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no
# activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax
# variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval
# interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response
# from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is
# set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be
# terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.
#
# Rationale
# ---------
# Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user
# access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't
# lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..
# While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on
# site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client
# session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be
# sent.
#
# Audit
# -----
# Run the following commands and verify ClientAliveInterval is 300 or less and
# ClientAliveCountMax is 3 or less:
#
#   # grep "^ClientAliveInterval" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   ClientAliveInterval 300
#   # grep "^ClientAliveCountMax" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   ClientAliveCountMax 0
#
# Remediation
# -----------
# Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters as follows:
#
#   ClientAliveInterval 300
#   ClientAliveCountMax 0

parameters:
  openssh:
    server:
      alive:
        interval: 300
        count: 0
