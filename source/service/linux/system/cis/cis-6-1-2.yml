# CIS 6.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd are configured
#
# Description
# ===========
# The /etc/passwd file contains user account information that is used by
# many system utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities
# to operate.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# It is critical to ensure that the /etc/passwd file is protected from
# unauthorized write access. Although it is protected by default, the file
# permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and
# Access is 644 :
#
#   # stat /etc/passwd
#   Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: (0/root) Gid: (0/root)
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Run the following command to set permissions on /etc/passwd :
#
#   # chown root:root /etc/passwd
#   # chmod 644 /etc/passwd
#
