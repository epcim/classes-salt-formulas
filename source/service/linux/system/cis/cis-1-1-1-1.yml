# 1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The cramfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem
# embedded in small footprint systems. A cramfs image can be used without
# having to first decompress the image.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack
# surface of the server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v cramfs
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep cramfs
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install cramfs /bin/true
#
