# 1.1.1.5 Ensure mounting of hfsplus filesystems is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The hfsplus filesystem type is a hierarchical filesystem designed to
# replace hfs that allows you to mount Mac OS filesystems.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack
# surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v hfsplus
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep hfsplus
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install hfsplus /bin/true
#
