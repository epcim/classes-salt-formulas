# 3.5.2 Ensure SCTP is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer
# protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several
# streams of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as
# TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented
# like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with
# congestion control like TCP.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module
# not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v sctp
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep sctp
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
#
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install sctp /bin/true
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      kernel:
        module:
          sctp:
            install:
              command: /bin/true
