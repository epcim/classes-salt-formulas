# CIS 1.1.14 Ensure nodev option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)
#
# Description
# ===========
# The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special
# devices.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Since the /run/shm filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this
# option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create special devices in
# /dev/shm partitions.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify that the nodev option is set on /dev/shm .
#
#   # mount | grep /dev/shm
#   shm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
#
# Remediation
# ===========
#
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options)
# for the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
# Run the following command to remount /dev/shm :
#
#   # mount -o remount,nodev /dev/shm
#
# CIS 1.1.15 Ensure nosuid option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)
#
# Description
# ===========
# The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid
# files.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing
# privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify that the no suid option is set on /dev/shm .
#
#   # mount | grep /dev/shm
#   shm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options)
# for the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
# Run the following command to remount /dev/shm :
#
#   # mount -o remount,nosuid /dev/shm
#
# 1.1.16 Ensure noexec option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)
#
# Description
# ===========
# The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain
# executable binaries.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs
# from shared memory. This deters users from introducing potentially malicious
# software on the system.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify that the noexec option is set on /run/shm .
#
#   # mount | grep /dev/shm
#   shm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options)
# for the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
# Run the following command to remount /dev/shm :
#
#   # mount -o remount,noexec /dev/shm
