# 1.1.1.3 Ensure mounting of jffs2 filesystems is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The jffs2 (journaling flash filesystem 2) filesystem type is a
# log-structured filesystem used in flash memory devices.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack
# surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v jffs2
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep jffs2
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install jffs2 /bin/true
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      kernel:
        module:
          jffs2:
            install:
              command: /bin/true
