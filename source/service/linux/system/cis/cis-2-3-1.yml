# 2.3.1 Ensure NIS Client is not installed
#
# Description
# ===========
# The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages,
# is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system
# configuration files. The NIS client ( ypbind ) was used to bind a machine
# to an NIS server and receive the distributed configuration files.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable
# to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying
# NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight
# Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the service be
# removed.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify nis is not installed:
#
#   dpkg -s nis
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Run the following command to uninstall nis:
#
#   apt-get remove nis
#
# Impact
# ======
# Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in
# testing environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test
# and troubleshoot. If they are required it is advisable to remove the clients
# after use to prevent accidental or intentional misuse.
