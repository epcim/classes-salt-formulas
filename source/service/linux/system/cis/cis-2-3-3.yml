# 2.3.3 Ensure talk client is not installed
#
# Description
# ===========
# The talk software makes it possible for users to send and receive messages
# across systems through a terminal session. The talk client, which allows
# initialization of talk sessions, is installed by default.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# The software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols
# for communication.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify talk is not installed:
#
#   dpkg -s talk
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Run the following command to uninstall talk :
#
#   apt-get remove talk
#
# Impact
# ======
# Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in
# testing environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test
# and troubleshoot. If they are required it is advisable to remove the clients
# after use to prevent accidental or intentional misuse.
