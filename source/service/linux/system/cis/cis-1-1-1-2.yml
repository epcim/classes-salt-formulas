# 1.1.1.2 Ensure mounting of freevxfs filesystems is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The freevxfs filesystem type is a free version of the Veritas type
# filesystem. This is the primary filesystem type for HP-UX operating systems.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack
# surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v freevxfs
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep freevxfs
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install freevxfs /bin/true
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      kernel:
