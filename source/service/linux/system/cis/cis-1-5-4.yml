# CIS 1.5.4 Ensure prelink is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# prelink is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically
# linked binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to
# perform relocations at startup significantly decreases.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# The prelinking feature can interfere with the operation of AIDE, because it
# changes binaries. Prelinking can also increase the vulnerability of the system
# if a malicious user is able to compromise a common library such as libc.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify prelink is not installed:
#
#   # dpkg -s prelink
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Run the following command to restore binaries to normal:
#
#   # prelink -ua
#
# Run the following command to uninstall prelink :
#
#   # apt-get remove prelink
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      package:
        prelink:
          version: removed
