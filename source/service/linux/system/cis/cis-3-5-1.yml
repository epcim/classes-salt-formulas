# 3.5.2 Ensure DCCP is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol
# that supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain
# access to congestion control, without having to do it at the application
# layer, but does not provide in-sequence delivery.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be
# installed to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v dccp
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep dccp
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install dccp /bin/true
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      kernel:
        module:
          dccp:
            install:
              command: /bin/true
