# Profile Applicability

#
# Description
# -----------
# The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user
# before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed.

# connection. Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the
# prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

# Audit

# Run the following command and verify that output matches:
#
#   # grep "^Banner" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   Banner /etc/issue.net

#
#  Banner /etc/issue.net
