# 5.2.5 Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less (Scored)
#
# Profile Applicability
# ---------------------
# - Level 1 - Server
# - Level 1 - Workstation
#
# Description
# -----------
# The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
# permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error
# messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure.
#
# Rationale
# ----------
# Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
# brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number
# based on site policy.
#
# Audit
# -----
# Run the following command and verify that output MaxAuthTries is 4 or less:
#
#   # grep "^MaxAuthTries" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   MaxAuthTries 4
#
# Remediation
# -----------
# Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
#
#   MaxAuthTries 4

parameters:
  openssh:
    server:
      max_auth_tries: 4
