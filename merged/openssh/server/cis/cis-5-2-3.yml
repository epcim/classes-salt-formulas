# 5.2.3 Ensure SSH LogLevel is set to INFO (Scored)
#
# Profile Applicability
# ---------------------
# - Level 1 - Server
# - Level 1 - Workstation
#
# Description
# -----------
# The INFO parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged.
#
# Rationale
# ---------
# SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically
# not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
# so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. INFO level is the
# basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident
# Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The
# logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.
#
# Audit
# -----
# Run the following command and verify that output matches:
#
#   # grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#   LogLevel INFO
#
# Remediation
# -----------
# Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
#
#   LogLevel INFO

parameters:
  openssh:
    server:
      log_level: INFO
