# 3.5.3 Ensure RDS is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol is a transport layer protocol
# designed to provide low-latency, high-bandwidth communications between
# cluster nodes. It was developed by the Oracle Corporation.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module
# not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v rds
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep rds
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install rds /bin/true
#
