# CIS 1.1.21 Disable Automounting
#
# Description
# ===========
# autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs
# and USB drives.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB
# drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked
# permissions to mount it themselves.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command to verify autofs is not enabled:
#
#   # systemctl is-enabled autofs
#   disabled
#
# Verify result is not "enabled".
#
# Remediation
# ===========
#
# Run the following command to disable autofs :
#
#   # systemctl disable autofs
#
# Impact
# ======
# The use portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your
# organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations
# and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there
# is little value add in turning off automounting.
#
# Notes
# =====
# This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives
# and optical media in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to
# manually mount media can be part of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of
# unapproved software or information being introduced or proprietary software
# or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly use flash drives and
# Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual mounting
# may not increase security.
