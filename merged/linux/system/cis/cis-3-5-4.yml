# 3.5.4 Ensure TIPC is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed
# to provide communication between cluster nodes.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module
# not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
#
#   # modprobe -n -v tipc
#   install /bin/true
#   # lsmod | grep tipc
#   <No output>
#
# Remediation
# ===========
#
# Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
#
#   install tipc /bin/true
#
