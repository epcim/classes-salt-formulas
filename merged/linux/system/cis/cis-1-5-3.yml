# 1.5.3 Ensure address space layout randomization (ASLR) is enabled
#
# Description
# ===========
#
# Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation technique which
# randomly arranges the address space of key data areas of a process.
#
# Rationale
# =========
#
# Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult to write memory page
# exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting.
#
# Audit
# =====
#
# Run the following command and verify output matches:
#
#   # sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space
#   kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
#
# Remediation
# ===========
#
# Set the following parameter in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:
#
#   kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
#
# Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:
#
#   # sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2

parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      kernel:
        sysctl:
          kernel.randomize_va_space: 2
