# CIS 6.1.5 Ensure permissions on /etc/gshadow are configured
#
# Description
# ===========
# The /etc/gshadow file is used to store the information about groups that
# is critical to the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password
# and other security information.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/gshadow file, they can easily
# run a password cracking program against the hashed password to break it.
# Other security information that is stored in the /etc/gshadow file (such as
# group administrators) could also be useful to subvert the group.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify verify Uid is 0/root ,
# Gid is <gid>/shadow , and Access is 640 or more restrictive:
#
#   # stat /etc/gshadow
#   Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: (0/root) Gid: (42/shadow)
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Run the following commands to set permissions on /etc/gshadow :
#
#   # chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow
#   # chmod o-rwx,g-rw /etc/gshadow
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      file:
        /etc/gshadow:
          user: 'root'
          group: 'shadow'
          mode: '0640'
