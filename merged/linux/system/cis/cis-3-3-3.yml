# CIS 3.3.3 Ensure IPv6 is disabled
#
# Description
# ===========
# Although IPv6 has many advantages over IPv4, few organizations have
# implemented IPv6.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# If IPv6 is not to be used, it is recommended that it be disabled to
# reduce the attack surface of the system.
#
# Audit
# ======
# Run the following command and verify that each linux line has
# the 'ipv6.disable=1' parameter set:
#
#   # grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Edit /etc/default/grub and add 'ipv6.disable=1' to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX:
#
#   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1"
#
# Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
#
#   # update-grub
#
parameters:
  linux:
    system:
      kernel:
        boot_options:
          - ipv6.disable=1
